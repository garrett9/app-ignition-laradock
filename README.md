### What is AppIgnition?
AppIgnition is a Docker Desktop extension that aims to simplify the application setup process and provide you with the most ideal development experience for new and existing Laravel applications. Continue reading for some possible use cases to see if AppIgnition is right for you!

#### Installing a New Laravel Application from Scratch
Installing a new application with all of the required software becomes a breeze through containerization! Configure your environment and containers through an elegant UI, specify your application's dependencies, and finish the installation within 15-20 minutes without ever having to worry about installing local versions of the software you need.

#### Running a Microservice Architecture
Simulate a realistic and ideal microservice architecture by installing several applications and having them communicate not just with your containers' services, but with each other as well.

#### Onboarding New Team Members
A common problem when adding new team members to your project is having to keep your onboarding documentation up to date. Moreover, it's possible for your new team member to join with different hardware other than what's documented. You can now simplify this process and turn what was once a several-day effort into a matter of minutes, enabling your team members to start contributing faster.

#### Experimenting with New Tools
Have you ever wanted to try out your application with a different database engine? Maybe you wanted to change the configuration of your web server to see if it has an impact on your responses. With AppIgnition, you can easily add or configure a new container to test your theory without any repercussions to your local environment.

#### Providing a Consistent CI/CD Pipeline
AppIgnition can automatically generate the required configuration files to run your continuous integration in GitHub or CircleCI. With this, you will get much more consistent results with your local environment since it is using the same containers and configurations that you are.
